Due to time constraints, I will design my solution in phases. This will allow me to design and develop a working solution which has most of the required features first, and then implement secondary features next. Therefore, if any problems occur whilst designing and developing the secondary features, it would not affect the primary features as they would have been completed.
The secondary features which I will implement in the future are:
•	An option for the server host to reorder the problem queue
•	An option for the server host to change the time for the problem
•	An option for the server host to create or edit problems
•	An option for the player to create custom tests
•	An option for the server host to kick and ban players
•	Additional game modes
•	Settings options for the players to change the aesthetics of the client program
•	Syntax, keyword and error highlighting in the player’s IDE
